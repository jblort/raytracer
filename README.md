C++ Project Template
====================

This is a simple project template that uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/), the package manager [Conan](https://conan.io/), and the test library [Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).

Its main purpose is to provide a project structure that is ready to go with only minimal adjustments depending on the project itself.

## Setup instructions

This project depends on CMake and Conan, which need to be installed prior to using this template.
* [CMake installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* [Conan installation instructions](http://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html)

The folder structure can be copied and used directly with only a few minor adjustments.

1. Modify the name of the project in the root `CMakeLists.txt`.
2. Add files to the `src` folder (CMake will warn at setup time that there is none otherwise).
3. Depending on whether you are building a library or not, you may want to tweak how headers are exported in `src/CMakeLists.txt`.

## Build instructions

### Unix/MacOS

From the root of the project:

1. `mkdir build && cd build`
2. `conan install .. && cmake .. && cmake --build .`
3. Run tests with `ctest -V`

### Windows
